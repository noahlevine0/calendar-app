Hey! Is this meant to be text?? Or code here? I'm still trying to figure all of this out. The text color is red so this looks like some code editor but whatever.

Had the genius idea to finally improve my organization. Being an ambitious coder, I knew i'd never succumb to the mundanity of Google Calendar. Here's my own spin on a calendar app
Since I hate setting plans, but need to stay organized and on top of things, hopefully this calendar app will help me get my stuff together

Functionality: 1. Monthly, weekly, and daily view 2. "Tasks" and "Events" - Tasks are things you have to do (work, eat dinner, go to gym, etc...), and Events are places you have to be
(zoom meeting, class, club meeting, etc...) 3. Option to bring up "To do list" that has a list of all tasks, due dates, and option to mark as completed 4. Handling recurring task/event

More might come, as of right now considering algorithm for work tasks? Maybe doing greedy based on the due date? Calculated bedtime and wakeup time to optimize x hours of sleep, maybe
some sort of organizational homework features? I'm super excited to tackle this though, hopefully I don't lose motivation in a few days. As of rn, my plan is just to get something to
work, and then i'll add a lot more functionality from there.

I just realized how many different CSS rule thingys i have to make. I thought it'd be much more simple than it actually is. I think that i'll try to get a working program in the next
few days, and then work from there. But it might take a while to do that.

I think as of right now I'm going to focus on getting something working, even if it doesn't look so good. Probably going to get minimal frontend work and just work on backend logic 
so I can make sure everything works as intended
